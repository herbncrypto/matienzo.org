> How do you invite people to slow down and spend more time investigating phenomena important to our time? Can we turn closets into libraries which reflect important ideas into a public sphere? Can garments be effective as living mobile archives on cotton? We want to consider the idea of ‘looking back to where we’ve come from to understand where we are now and where we’re heading’, and make it a practice. We want our projects to be reminders that everything is connected and constantly changing. Exploring and digesting ideas improves and expands us. In addition to disseminating information we want to promote the process of critical investigation through making. Any of our projects could live as an individual zine, film, podcast, article, exhibition, poster etc, though we believe garments have a unique potential to translate important information.
