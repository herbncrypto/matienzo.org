*   LIS 901-08
*   Palmer School of Library and Information Science, Long Island University
*   Instructor: Mark A. Matienzo
*   Wednesdays, 6:30-8:20 PM, Fall 2009

### Overview

This class aims to prepare students to think proactively, creatively, and critically about planning, implementing, and evaluating digital library projects in a variety of institutions. In addition, this class is designed as a seminar to allow proactive discussion of topics between both the students and the instructor; this format allows you to learn from each other as well as from me.

Given constraints on the class, you are not expected to have a background or experience with particular library technologies. Accordingly, this course cannot teach you exhaustive skills that will allow you to build digital libraries. This course will instead focus instruction in two main areas: the major infrastructural components of digital library projects (metadata, software architectures, etc.), and aspects of the social and technical impact of digital libraries that lead to their success or failure (sustainability, usability, audience, etc.)

### Objectives

This class aims to teach students how:

*   to read and evaluate technical and research-based articles on digital libraries without having exhaustive knowledge in particular technologies or subject areas,
*   to evaluate proposed digital library projects in international and inter-institutional contexts,
*   to gain a high-level understanding of the interplay between the technologies, social practices, and people involved in digital library projects, and
*   to understand why certain project plans, technologies, and evaluation strategies have or have not been proven successful in digital libraries.

### Required Texts and Readings

We will be relying on the following two books heavily throughout the class. I recommend purchasing them, but they are also available on reserve at the NYU Bobst Library Reserve desk. *Digital Library Use* is also available as an eBook through LIU; ask me for more details if you'd prefer to use the eBook version.

*   Bishop, Ann Peterson, Nancy A. Van House, and Barbara P. Buttenfield, eds. *Digital Library Use: Social Practice in Design and Evaluation*. The MIT Press, 2003.
*   Reese, Terry, and Kyle Banerjee. *Building Digital Libraries: A How-to-do-it Manual.* 1st ed. Neal Schuman Publishers, 2007.

All other readings are available online either freely or through LIU's electronic journal subscriptions. Each week's readings are split up into **required** and **supplemental readings**. As this suggests, you are obligated to complete the required readings before class. The supplemental readings complement and build on the required readings and are optional.

### Course Policies

*   It is your responsibility to attend class. If you miss class for any reason without notifying or following up with the instructor, you will get a zero grade for class participation for that week. **If you must miss class, please contact the instructor at least 3 hours in advance if possible.** You may miss class for medical reasons, work-related reasons, or religious reasons if you give the instructor advance notice. If you are sick, have an emergency, or must miss class for any other reason on short notice, please contact the instructor as soon as is feasible. Please refer to the "class participation" section under Grading and Assignments about your responsibilities for participating even if you miss class.
*   **Assignments are due on the date indicated ** (or the date chosen in the case the of leading class discussion and summarizing that week's readings).
*   **Plagiarism is an extremely serious matter.** All submissions must be your own work in your own words. You can incorporate excerpts or ideas from other sources, but they must be properly attributed. In addition, you can get assistance with copy-editing or discuss ideas with your classmates or other people, but all content must be your own or otherwise explicitly cited. Please familiarize yourself the information on preventing and detecting plagiarism, available at <http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/exhibits/plagiarism.htm>. In particular, please note "*academic irregularities or dishonesty, such as plagiarism and cheating, may result in an automatic failure in a course and dismissal from the program.*"
*   In addition, this instructor and this course will follow Long Island University's academic policy, available at <http://www.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/stuact/acadconductpol.html>.

### Grading and Assignments

*Note: All written assignments must be completed with citations formatted using the Chicago Manual of style.*

*   Class participation (35%). This class will be taught as a seminar. You will be expected to complete the week's required readings and be prepared to discuss them; you are also strongly urged to complete as many of the supplemental readings as is feasible. Obviously, attendance is a factor. If you miss class, you must discuss the week's readings on the class Google Group.
*   Two instances of leading class discussion and written summaries for weekly readings (15% each). During the semester, you will choose two classes where you and a few of your other classmates will be responsible for leading discussion. For each class you choose, you will need to 1) prepare a brief (five-minute) summary that you'll use to start discussion, and 2) a three to five page written summary each summarizing the week's readings. Your summaries should discuss any connections or conflicts you see between the articles. Potential areas of discussion appear below each week's readings on the syllabus; these are merely suggested, and you are encouraged to think of your own topics for discussion. The written summary is due at the beginning of the class in which you lead discussion.=
*   A final project/paper (20%), an accompanying proposal (10%), and a brief presentation (5%) on your project during the one of last two classes (December 9 and 16). You will be expected to write a detailed research paper on some aspect of digital libraries that we cover during the course or implement a small-scale digital library project in some capacity. To ensure your project is feasible given the time allotted for the assignment, you must write a two to three page proposal and meet with the instructor to discuss your plans.** This part of the assignment is mandatory.** Finally, you will be required to present on your project during the last class sessions. Further details about this assignment are forthcoming.
*   There is also an optional extra credit assignment. See December 2 for more detail.

*   Are the examples represented by the other readings "transparent" to the user given the description by Star, Bowker, and Neumann?
*   What is the social and technical impact of putting restrictions on various types of workflows? Consider the examples given by Green and Awre, Daines and Nimer, and Waugh.
*   How do you think Krevit and Crays could have better "herded their cats"?

Potential topics for discussion:

*   Does a digital library always have to be designed for a specific user community to be successful?
*   How do boundaries as described by Lervik, et al. inhibit or allow for digital libraries aimed at a broad user community?
*   Give your description of what you view as an ideal user community for the design of a digital library project.
*   What are the common aspects and distinctions between the methodologies used by Marchioni, et al. and Bishop, et al.?
*   Is a well-designed trans-national or global digital library possible? Consider Marlow, et al. as well as projects such as Europeana or the World Digital Library. Given the types of infrastructure we have studied, where do you see the largest problems coming up?

Potential topics for discussion:

*   What do you think are the most important aspects of designing a digital library for usability?
*   What is needed for minimal access to digital libraries?
*   Is search sufficient? How can users benefit from interfaces that allow for visualization?
*   What would your ideal discovery interface for digital libraries look like?

**November 25** [No class (Thanksgiving break).]

**December 2** [No class, but see below.]

*   Federated and distributed architectures and "the cloud."

*Note:* You are still expected to do the readings and participate in class discussion this week via the class email list. In addition, you ave the option of turning in a briefer written summary (a maximum of 3 pages), addressing what you thought were the most important aspects of the articles for the week and connecting the ideas to other concepts brought up in class. This extra credit is worth about 5% of your final grade, or approximately a partial letter grade (e.g. the difference between an A- and an A). The extra credit assignment is due by the beginning of class that week.
