<p>Over the last few months, I've been working on a consulting project for the <a href="http://www.brooklynhistory.org/">Brooklyn Historical Society</a>, whose catablog, <a href="http://www.brooklynhistory.org/library/wp/">Emma</a>, runs on WordPress. Because of a large number of grant projects in which the BHS staff are using Archivists' Toolkit to add lots of resource records, they needed a way to add individual as well as sets of collection descriptions to WordPress using an easy procedure.</p>
<p>The solution I created for them was the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/bhs-marcxml-importer">BHS MARCXML Importer</a> plugin. The plugin allows you to import data from XML files containing MARCXML records or Zip files containing sets of such XML files and create posts with that data. Currently, the mappings are mostly fixed, and tailored for MARCXML records that describe archival material.  The plugin requires Dan Scott's fabulous <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/File_MARC">File_MARC PEAR module</a> for parsing the records. Please feel free to test it and give me any feedback as appropriate. There is some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nyFao5zOC9qU7y_FZPjFqt3P77kHJZserrB43hJyZ9Q/edit?hl=en_US">detailed documentation</a> available in addition to the readme file. I am also <a href="http://github.com/anarchivist/bhs-marcxml-importer">hosting the code using Github</a>, so feel free to dig into the code there.</p>
<p>This tool was created as part of the project, "Uncovering the Secrets of Brooklyn's 19th Century Past: Creation to Consolidation," funded by the Council on Library and Information Resources, with additional support from The Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation.</p>
