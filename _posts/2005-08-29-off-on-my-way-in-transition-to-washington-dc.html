<p>I'm pleased to announce that I will be joining the staff of the National Anthropological Archives and Human Studies Film Archives of the Smithsonian Institution's Department of Anthropology as a project archivist.  I will have two initial primary responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>cataloging Plains Indian <a href="http://plainsledgerart.org/">ledger art</a> for the non-profit <a href="http://www.artstor.org/info/">ARTstor Project</a>,</li>
<li>and original cataloging and bibliographic enhancement of audio, film and video collections in support of the NAA's new Endangered Languages Program. This program also collaborates with the University of Utah's <a href="http://www.hum.utah.edu/cail/">Center for American Indian Languages</a> and is also part of the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2004/nsf04605/nsf04605.htm">Documenting Endangered Languages</a> project, supported by the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will be starting work for the NAA/HSFA on September 6, 2005, and will be working on a 12 month term contract.</p>
