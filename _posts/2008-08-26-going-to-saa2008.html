<p>I'm packing up and heading out to SFO this evening for <a href="http://www.archivists.org/conference/sanfrancisco2008">SAA2008</a>. Right now I'm frantically backing up my Zotero repository, making sure I have a bunch of sources to peruse on the plane as I hack away on my slides for <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/saawiki/2008/index.php/EAD%4010:_A_Symposium_Celebrating_the_10th_Anniversary_of_Encoded_Archival_Description">EAD@10</a>. You might be surprised that my idea of me jumping out of a cake in the shape of an <a href="http://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/archdesc.html">&lt;archdesc&gt; tag</a> wearing a bathing suit was not even considered, so it looks like I'll actually have to put some coherent thoughts together. I've got to make a grand entrance somehow. I'll be chairing the <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/saawiki/2008/index.php/Description_Section_Meeting">Description Section meeting as well</a>, so behave yourselves, kids.</p>
