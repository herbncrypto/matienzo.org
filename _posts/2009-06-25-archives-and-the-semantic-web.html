<p>This last Tuesday, I spoke at the Annual Meeting of the <a href="http://www.nycarchivists.org/">Archivists' Roundtable of Metropolitan New York</a>, where I gave a talk on archives and the Semantic Web. The presentation went over very well, and colleagues from both the archives field and the semantic technology field were in attendance. I did my best to keep the presentation not overtly technical and cover just enough to get archivists to think about how things could be in the future. I also have to give a big hat tip to <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/">Dan Chudnov</a>, whose <a href="http://onebiglibrary.net/story/tcdl-2009-talk-better-living-through-linking">recent keynote at the Texas Conference on Digital Libraries</a> helped me organize my thoughts. Enjoy the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/anarchivist/archives-the-semantic-web">slides</a>, and as always, I relish any feedback from the rest of you.</p>
