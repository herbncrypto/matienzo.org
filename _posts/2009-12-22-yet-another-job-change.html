<p>It's fitting that this the hundredth (gosh, only the <em>hundredth</em>?) post, because I have rather important news. First, my fellow developers/producers/UX designers at The New York Public Library and I have been dealing with every minute detail on the upcoming, Drupal-based replacement to the NYPL website. You can see a live preview at <a href="http://new.nypl.org/">http://new.nypl.org/</a>. I can proudly say that this project has helped both me personally and NYPL overall play nice in the open source world - we've been actively contributing code, reporting bugs, and sending patches to the Drupal project. Also, our site search is based on Solr, which always bears mention.</p>
<p>In addition, after a working tirelessly as a developer at NYPL for the last year and a half, I have decided to move onward and upward. I am leaving the cozy environs of the still-recently renovated office space I share with my spectacular coworkers. It was not an easy decision by far, but it feels like the best one overall. I am leaving NYPL for the Ivy League; at the end of January, I will be starting as a Digital Archivist with <a href="http://www.library.yale.edu/mssa/">Manuscripts and Archives at the Yale University Library</a>. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm looking forward to being part of an incredibly strong archival community. I will be working with fantastic people on interesting projects in the field in which I was educated in and to which I feel the strongest bond. It's the perfect blend of traditional archives work, code and metadata geekery, and digital preservation!</p>
<p>Wish me luck, and if you're ever in New Haven, I'll split a white clam pie and a pitcher of birch beer with you at <a href="http://www.modernapizza.com/">Modern</a>.</p>
