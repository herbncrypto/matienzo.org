<p><em>What exactly is archival access, and how does archival description make it possible? </em>I feel like that in some form or another I've been struggling with this question throughout my career. Recently, <a href="http://libtmp.lib.utsa.edu/blogs/index.php/2009/10/09/accessibility-milestone?blog=7">this blog post</a> from <a href="http://libtmp.lib.utsa.edu/blogs/index.php?blog=7">The Top Shelf</a>, the blog of the University of Texas at San Antonio Archives and Special Collections Department, came across my radar, wherein they write (emphasis in original):</p>
<blockquote><p>UTSA Archives and Special Collections is among the growing number of archives to create an online presence for <strong>every one of its collections</strong>. ... We were able to utilize inventories generated by former and current collection assistants to create guides to the collection with folder-level and box-level descriptions. The project resulted in access to more than 130 collections and 2000 linear feet of materials.</p></blockquote>
<p>What defines that accessibility? I certainly don't intend to be a negative Nancy about this - adding finding aids and other descriptive metadata about collections is obviously useful. But how has it necessarily increased access to the materials themselves?</p>
<p>Archivists in part provide descriptive, contextual, and structural metadata about collections, but ultimately, the products of our knowledge work are merely representations of a complex whole, teeming with relationships between facts, assumptions, and wild-arsed guesses. Thinking of arrangement and description as representation is not a new idea; cf. Yakel, "Archival Representation" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Archival Science</span> 3, no. 1 (2003): 1-25<span class="Z3988" title="url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Archival%20Representation&amp;rft.jtitle=Archival%20Science&amp;rft.volume=3&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.aufirst=Elizabeth&amp;rft.aulast=Yakel&amp;rft.au=Elizabeth%20Yakel&amp;rft.date=2003&amp;rft.pages=1-25">)</span> and Karen Gracy's <a href="http://www.sis.pitt.edu/~kgracy/LIS_2224_Spring_2007.htm">class on Archival Representation</a> at Pitt. But really, what is the end goal of that representation and how does that converge with what users and our professional peers (e.g. library and museum professionals) expect?</p>
<p>Our professional community is still a bit too sheltered, I'm afraid. I really disagree with Russell James' recent post "<a href="http://recordsjunkie.blogspot.com/2009/09/why-not-records-science.html">Why not 'records science'?</a>" for a few reasons (just as I agree with him on a few points...for what it's worth, there <em>is</em> records science; it just happens to be called <a href="http://cf.hum.uva.nl/bai/home/eketelaar/information.html"><em>archivistics</em> or <em>archival science</em></a>!). Archivists still have a ridiculous amount to learn about information science. It might not have seemed relevant during whatever graduate program you attended, but really, it's ultra-important!</p>
<p>I'm reading <a href="http://www.bus.umich.edu/FacultyBios/FacultyBio.asp?id=000120060">David C. Blair</a>'s <span style="font-style: italic;"><a href="http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20670761">Language and Representation in Information Retrieval</a></span> (Elsevier Science &amp; Technology, 1990<span class="Z3988" title="url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=urn%3Aisbn%3A0444884378&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&amp;rft.genre=book&amp;rft.btitle=Language%20and%20Representation%20in%20Information%20Retrieval&amp;rft.publisher=Elsevier%20Science%20%26%20Technology&amp;rft.aufirst=D.%20C.&amp;rft.aulast=Blair&amp;rft.au=D.%20C.%20Blair&amp;rft.date=1990-04-04&amp;rft.isbn=0444884378">)</span> right now and am totally riveted by it. This and other works consistently prove to me that we have a lot of important lessons to learn from our counterparts in other fields, namely how metadata, indexing, and the like actually form sets of representations that unavoidably mediate access between a person with an information need and that information. This isn't new research, and it's not just a problem with electronic records. It's just incredibly unfortunate that there isn't a really good community within the profession to discuss this stuff.</p>
<p>You haven't heard the last of me on this yet, and I know this post has been quite rambling. Until next time...</p>
