<p>It was <a href="/2006/announcing-archivesblogs">one year ago today</a> that I made <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a> available to the public. Time sure seems to fly by fast! Since then there have been a lot of changes - layout, platform, and hosting - but still, I remain involved for the long haul. Thanks to all who provided suggestions, submitted blogs to be syndicated, and any other guidance along the way. ArchivesBlogs now syndicates nearly 100 blogs in 9 languages!</p>
