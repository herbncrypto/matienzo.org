<p>It's good to see other people using your code. Thanks to the <a href="http://worldcat.org/devnet/blog/2009/05/worldcat_mashathon_a_huge_succ.html">OCLC Devnet Blog</a>, I found out that <a href="http://blog.pos.thum.us/">Etienne Posthumus</a> used <a href="https://github.com/anarchivist/worldcat/">worldcat</a> for a demo application he built during the <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/devnet/wiki/2009EUMashathon">WorldCat Mashathon</a> in Amsterdam last week. Even more interesting is that Etienne's application was deployed on <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>. Courtesy of OCLC's Alice Sneary, there is a brief video of Etienne presenting his application to the other Mashathon attendees:</p>
