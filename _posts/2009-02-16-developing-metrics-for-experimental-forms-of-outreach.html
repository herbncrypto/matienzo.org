<p><a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/">ArchivesNext</a> recently inquired about how <a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/?p=239">archivists measure success of 2.0 initiatives</a>. It's hard to determine some 2.0-ish initiatives will really impact statistics when you don't really define what the results you're trying to see. I'd like to open the question further — how do we begin developing metrics for things that sit on the cusp between forms of outreach? Furthermore, I'm curious to see where this information is captured — do archivists wait until the end to gather survey data, or if they working towards something like we at <a href="http://labs.nypl.org/">NYPL Labs</a> are doing with <a href="http://labs.nypl.org/2009/02/16/introducing-infomaki-bite-sized-usability-testing/">Infomaki</a>, our new usability tool developed by <a href="http://technofetish.com/">Michael Lascarides</a>, our user analyst.</p>
