<p>Since my <a href="/2006/syndicating-archives-blogs">last post</a> about syndicating blogs about archives, I've played around with the idea and different software packages to do it, including <a href="http://planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> and <a href="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</a>. I'm happy to announce that after a few days work I was able to put something together.</p>
<p><a href="http://archivesblogs.com/"><strong>ArchivesBlogs</strong></a> is an aggregator for blogs about archives. It runs Plagger and updates hourly, outputting HTML, RSS, Atom, OPML (for import into other aggregator), and a FOAFroll. The site design is simple, but i'm happy with it. I took whatever archives blogs I knew about and added them, so if you know of any others or you want yours removed, let me know.</p>
