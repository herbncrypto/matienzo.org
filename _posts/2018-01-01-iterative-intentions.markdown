While I enjoy seeing what my friends are setting their intentions towards in the
new year, I don't really believe in new year's resolutions for myself. They tend
to wear on me heavily whenever I've proclaimed a long list of things I'm hoping
to get better at. Instead, this year, I'm starting with a very short list. My
hope is that I can commit to a small number of good habits at a time, which I
can then build on iteratively. I want to have the windows of reinforcement stay
small at first (maybe a week or two), and once I feel satisfied about whichever
habits I've committed to, I can add more.

I'm starting with three items:

* Rebuilding this website: simplified tooling; new layout/style; using and
publishing more structured data, and a partial implementation of a stack
following [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/) and [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/)
principles. The last part is intentionally slippery, but I mostly really care
about sending and receiving notifications at this point. I'm giving myself about
a week to get this done.
* Eating better breakfasts. I started 2018 with overnight oats, which happened
to be mildly successful. I have a lot to master in terms of proportions and
taste, to say the least.
* Budgeting and financial tracking to better understand my ongoing expenses.
This is something I'm undertaking with my partner, and we have actionable
(but private) goals for this.

Wish me luck.
