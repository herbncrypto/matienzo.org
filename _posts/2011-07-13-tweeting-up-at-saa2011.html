<p>Thanks to the great work of <a href="http://newarchivist.com/2010/08/05/all-archivists-tweetup/">Lance</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/newmsi">@newmsi</a>), Rachel Donahue (<a href="http://twitter.com/sheepeeh">@sheepeeh</a>), and Angelique Richardson (<a href="http://twitter.com/RandomArchivist">@RandomArchivist</a>) last year, the first SAA Tweetup was pulled off successfully in Washington, DC. Given that this year's SAA Annual Meeting is just a few weeks away, Hillel Arnold (<a href="http://twitter.com/helrond">@helrond</a>) and I have elected to organize one in Chicago, as well.</p>
<p>We're holding <a href="http://twtvite.com/saa11tweetup">this year's Tweetup</a> on Thursday, August 25, starting at 9 PM, at the <a href="http://clarkstreetalehouse.com/">Clark Street Ale House</a>, which is about a mile from the conference hotel and easily walkable and accessible by public transportation. Feel free to join us after the alumni mixers - and please join us even if you don't use Twitter.</p>
<p>Please RSVP at <a href="http://twtvite.com/saa11tweetup">http://twtvite.com/saa11tweetup</a>; while RSVPs are not required, they will help us and the bar plan ahead.</p>
