<p>ArchivesNext <a href="http://www.archivesnext.com/?p=48">recently discussed</a> the possibility of having some "Archives 2.0"-themed events this summer, and I think it's a great idea. Now, we may not be able to throw something together in time for SAA, but it seems like the idea of at least meeting up informally is percolating. There's a wealth of opportunities available for archives and archivists to improve access to their holdings through social software and the like. My vision, as I said in a comment on the post, would be to end up with an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference">unconference</a> along the lines of a <a href="http://librarycampnyc.wikispaces.com/">Library Camp</a> (or more generally, a <a href="http://barcamp.org/">BarCamp</a>), maybe with lightning talks if enough of us have something to show off or talk about. Like Library Camp, I'd like to see a "bridging the gap" session where we learn and share ways about how to talk to IT staff and other stakeholders essential to our ideas taking off. I facilitated a such a session at Library Camp East, and although trying at times, it was really instructive. But really, it's not just about what I want - what do you all want to see at an Archives Camp?</p>
