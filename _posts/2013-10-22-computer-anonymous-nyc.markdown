In my [previous post](/blog/2013/privilege-archives-technology), I wrote about wanting to address issues of privilege in the space between archives and technology. As a first step, I mentioned organizing a New York group of [Computer Anonymous](http://computeranonymous.org). I'm pleased to announce that we've scheduled our [first meeting](http://computeranonymous.org/us_newyork.html#meetings):

**Tuesday, October 29, 2013, 6:30 PM - ?, at [Pacific Standard](http://www.pacificstandardbrooklyn.com/), 82 Fourth Avenue, Brooklyn, NY**

We have about seven people who have indicated that they're planning on attending. If you're interested, please comment here, contact me via Twitter or Email, or leave a comment on this [Github issue](https://github.com/computeranonymous/computer/issues/185).

I believe that a Computer Anonymous group in New York is a great chance to start having both tough and positive conversations. I realize that it won't solve everything, and that our initial location may not be ideal, but I'm certainly amenable to other ideas and doing better outreach. I want to see both the technology and archives professions become more diverse, more equitable, and healther communities that in which I can encourage others to join.
