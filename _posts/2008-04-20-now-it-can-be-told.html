<p>After a little over two years processing, referencing, and cataloging, and hacking at <a href="http://www.aip.org/history/nbl/">AIP</a>, I'm skipping up to the City That Never Sleeps to join <a href="http://bookism.org/">Jay Datema</a>, <a href="http://www.epistemographer.com/">Josh Greenberg</a>, and company in the <a href="http://labs.nypl.org/">NYPL Labs</a>. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thrilled about this opportunity, and I'm ready to see where my new job will take me. The next major hurdle will be finding a place to live, so if you're privy to anything in Brooklyn, please let me know.</p>
