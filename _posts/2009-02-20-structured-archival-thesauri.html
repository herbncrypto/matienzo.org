<p>The Society of American Archivists released the <a href="http://www.archivists.org/publications/epubs/thesaurus.asp">Thesaurus for Use in College and University Archives</a> as an electronic publication this week. Specifically, it was issued as a series of PDF files. Is this data stored in some sort of structured format somewhere? If so, it's not available directly from the SAA site. There's no good reason why TUCUA shouldn't be converted to structured, linkable data, expressed using <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/">SKOS, the Simple Knowledge Organization System</a>. It's not like I need another project, but I'm sure I could write some scraper to harvest the terms out of the PDF, and while I'm at it, I could write one to also harvest the <a href="http://www.archivists.org/glossary/term_details.asp?DefinitionKey=1185">Glossary of Archival Terminology</a>. Someone, please stop me. I really don't need another project.</p>
