<p>I've had my hands full lately. Two weeks ago I was at the <a href="http://www.mcn.edu/conferences"><abbr title="Museum Computer Network">MCN</abbr> conference</a> (wherein, among other things, I have continued my dominion as Archduke of Archival Description by taking over the MCN Standards SIG chair position from The Bancroft Library's Mary Elings), and next week I'm off to Philadelphia for the <abbr title="Philadelphia Area Consortium of Special Collections Libraries">PACSCL </abbr><a href="http://www.pacsclsurvey.org/snso.htm">Something New for Something Old</a> conference. I hammered out the coherent, written version of my paper I gave at <a href="http://www.archivists.org/publications/epubs/EAD@10.asp">EAD@10</a>. I prepared a <a href="http://library.brown.edu/code4libcon09/proposals/list/#how-anarchivist-got-his-groove-back-2-dvcs-ar">proposal</a> for next February's code4lib conference in Providence (ahem, <a href="http://code4lib.org/node/265">vote</a> for mine, if you're so inclined):</p>
<blockquote><p>Building on Galen Charlton's investigations into <a href="http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/86">distributed version control systems for metadata management</a>, I offer a prototype system for managing archival finding aids in EAD (Encoded Archival Description). My prototype relies on distributed version control to help archivists maintain transparency in their work and uses post-commit hooks to initiate indexing and publishing processes. In addition, this prototype can be generalized for any XML-based metadata schema.</p></blockquote>
<p>On top of that, I'm working with a fine group of folks on the RLG Programs project to <a href="http://www.oclc.org/programs/ourwork/collectivecoll/archives/EADtools.htm">analyze EAD editing and creation tools</a>, doing hardcore schema mapping at work, and somehow finding enough time to play a little <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/index.php">Doukutsu Monogatari</a> to unwind. And you guys wonder why I never blog.</p>
<p>Oh, and last but not least, I got an <abbr title="International Standard Serial Number">ISSN</abbr>. That's right, folks, <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/issn/1943-6653/">I've hit the big time</a>.</p>
