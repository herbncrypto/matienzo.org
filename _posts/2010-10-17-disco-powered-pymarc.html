<p>I'd been long interested in starting to develop code using some sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce</a> implementation for distributed computing. I have never been able to get my head around <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a>, so I gave up with that pretty quickly. I recently discovered <a href="http://www.discoproject.org/">Disco</a>, a MapReduce framework with an Erlang-based core. Disco also allows you to to write your worker code in Python, which was a huge plus to me.</p>
<p>After stumbling through the tutorial, I took the word count demo and put together some basic code using <a href="http://github.com/edsu/pymarc">pymarc</a> that gathered tag count statistics for a bunch of MARC files. The code's still in a very early form, and arguably should carve up large files into smaller chunks to pass off to the worker processes; I've gotten around this for the time being by splitting up the files using <a href="http://www.indexdata.com/yaz/doc/yaz-marcdump.html">yaz-marcdump</a>. Once I split the files, I pushed them into a tag of DDFS, the Disco Distributed File System. This was a useful way for me to write some demo code both for using pymarc and Disco. The code follows, and is also available as a <a href="http://gist.github.com/625558">Gist on Github</a>.</p>
