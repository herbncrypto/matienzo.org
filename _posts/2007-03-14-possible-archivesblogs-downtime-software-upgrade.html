<p>I finally noticed that <a href="http://projects.radgeek.com/feedwordpress/">FeedWordPress</a>, the plugin I use to maintain ArchivesBlogs, has been updated within the last month to work with WordPress 2.1 and higher. I hope to get this working pretty soon, but I apologize in advance if it ends up going down for a few days.</p>
