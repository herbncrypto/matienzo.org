<p>Every project has it's day. I've administered <a href="http://archivesblogs.com/">ArchivesBlogs</a> for four years now. Originally, I created it to fill a void when blogging was new to the archival profession, and archivists were having to make the case for dedicating staff time to shepherding early social media projects. Four years later, things are much different; I'm less interested in Web 2.0 (professionally speaking), more archivists are blogging, and more repositories are maintaining their own blogs.</p>
<p>Despite the changes in the archival blogosphere and repository administration, archivists still contact me occasionally and remind me of the value of ArchivesBlogs. It's also lead to some <a href="/2006/responsetolannon">interesting debates</a> in the past. I still think it has its place, but I don't want to be the only person shaping its future. I've also been thinking for a while that I want to get out of the  aggregation business, and I believe time to put together a  succession plan.</p>
<p>The reality is that I don't have the time to rethink what ArchivesBlogs could be, or even give it the care and feeding it needs to keep running. In short, I'm looking for help. No, scratch that.</p>
<p>I'm looking for someone to take over ArchivesBlogs. You certainly won't go it alone - I'll help with the transition period, and it's even possible I'll help with a migration from its WordPress-based install to something slicker or even something simpler. Either way, please let me know if it's something you're interested in helping with. It would arguably be even better if several individuals were interested in helping out. While strong tech skills aren't essential, they'll certainly help, and if you don't have the, already, you'll likely pick some up in the process.</p>
<p>What you'd need to know and/or learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>Running a content management system like WordPress or Drupal</li>
<li>Some knowledge of HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of PHP and how to work with a MySQL database</li>
<li>Connecting to remote machines using SSH and SFTP</li>
</ul>
<p>As a reminder, ArchivesBlogs is hosted by <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/">ibiblio.org</a>, so you wouldn't have to foot the bill for hosting the site personally. archivesblogs.com is registered through August of 2012, and I'd certainly be willing to contribute several more years' worth of registration fees in the interim.</p>
<p>Please leave me a comment if you're interested or have any ideas. I realize that someone may propose the possibility of SAA hosting ArchivesBlogs. This might be a plausible idea, but would likely require more substantial planning than for which I have time.</p>
