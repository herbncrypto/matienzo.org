<p>The moderated discussion hosted and sponsored by <a href="http://www.nylink.org/events/wc_policy.cfm">Nylink</a> went pretty well. Also, I don't need the records to have fun with the data "” I just need robust APIs. (In fact, as I said today, I'd prefer not to have to deal with the MARC records directly.) Robust APIs would help making prototypes like this one I hacked together in a few hours into a real, usable service.</p>
