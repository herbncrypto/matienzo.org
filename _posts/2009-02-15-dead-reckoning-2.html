<p>So, it's time for another rant about my issues with EAD. This one is a pretty straightforward and short one, and comes down to the issue that I should essentially be able to mix and match metadata schemas. <a href="http://www10.org/cdrom/papers/572/">This is not</a> <a href="http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue25/app-profiles/">a new idea</a>, and I'm tired of the archives community treating it like it is one. Application profiles, as they are called, allow us to define a structured way to combine elements from different schemas, prevent addition of new and arbitrary elements, and tighten existing standards for particular use cases.</p>
<p>However, to a certain extent, the EAD community has accepted the concept of combining XML namespaces but on a very limited level. The creation of the EAD 2002 Schema allows EAD data to be embedded into other XML documents, such as METS. However, I can't do it the other way around; for example, I can't work a MODS or MARCXML record into a finding aid. Why not? As I said in<a href="/2008/dead-reckoning"> my last dEAD Reckoning rant</a> as well as during my talk at <a href="http://archivists.org/publications/proceedings/EAD@10.asp">EAD@10</a>, the use of encoding analog attributes is misguided, confusing, and just plain annoying. Let's move on — give me a schema I can stick things into and pull stuff out of!</p>
